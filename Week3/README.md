For more information about the <a href="https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/">week 3</a> challenge. 

### Introduction
Danny loves cooking and streaming shows. He realized that there was a large gap in the market, namely, the food related content only streaming network! From this realization, Danny has decided to enlist me as part of the original startup team for Foodie-Fi. Foodie-Fi plans on selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on demand access to world wide food videos.

### Problem Statement
To increase the number of subscriptions, I have been tasked with analyzing digital data about our current users. Danny is looking for a description about each customer's onboarding journey and then the analytical questions.
### Data
Danny is proving me 2 datasets to use for the analysis
 - plans
 - subscriptions

Along with an ERD.
